# Hello!
If you want to contribute, I thank you in advance. This document will have some basic guidelines for contributing.

## Did you find a bug?
*Well, to submit an **Issue** of your discovery you should:*

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the Issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the **exact** steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by including the data that was used. You should also add what combination of options were used. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. 
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. If possible, include links to files or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Try to include screenshots (*or even animated GIFs*) which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
* If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
* Lastly, include proper labels for the issue, being the **bug** label essential.
## Do you want to suggest a feature?
*Suggestions are always welcomed:*

* Start by submitting an **Issue** about the feature you want to suggest.
  * Explain in what way it would improve the program as a whole.
  * Explain how it relates to the topic (Frequecy Distributions and variants) and the theory of it.
  * Add the appropiate labels for your issue. This includes the **enhancement** label.
* Create a new branch with a clear and descriptive title for your submission.
* When you are ready, make a **pull request** linking it to the Issue that you submitted before.
* If you want to suggest the feature, but you don't now how to actually implement it:
  * Don't worry, just submitt the Issue. Describe the feature as good as you can.
  * I will have a look at it, and if the feature helps the program as a whole, I will do my best effort to try to develop it, and give you credit for the suggestion.
