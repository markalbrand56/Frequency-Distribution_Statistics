# Frequency-Distribution_Statistics
This is a tool to help with Statistics problems of the topic "Frecuency Distributions", more specifically "Grouped Frequency Distributions"

I want for this program to be able to calculate all the results for the exercises/problems of these topics.
As of v0.3.0, these are the operations the program can do, plus the frequencies of each individual number:
