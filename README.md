# Frequency-Distribution_Statistics
This is a tool with the goal to help students with Statistics problems of the topic "Frequency Distributions", and its sub-topics like "Grouped Frequency Distributions"

If you don't understand a term from the python files, there's a high chance it's my traduction. I had this topic in Spanish.

I want for this program to be able to calculate all the results for the exercises/problems of these topics.
As of v0.3.0, these are the operations the program can do:
* Frequencies for each number
  * Simple Frequencies
  * Cumulative Frequencies
* Grouped frequencies
  * Simple and Cumulative
  * Option to choose a groups' width/size if possible. (Only whole numbers)
  * Option to force a width when the program couldn't calculate one
  * Class Centers
  * Real groups
  
*The program only accepts possitive numbers with up to 1 decimal position*
