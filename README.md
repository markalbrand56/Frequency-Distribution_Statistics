# Frequency-Distribution_Statistics
This is a tool to help with Statistics problems of the topic "Frecuency Distributions", more specifically "Grouped Frequency Distributions"

My plan is for it to be able to calculate the range, the intervals and do the tables.

If you don't understand a term from the python files, there's a high chance it's my traduction. I had this topic in Spanish.
