# Frequency-Distribution_Statistics
This is a tool with the goal to help students with Statistics problems of the topic "Frequency Distributions", and its sub-topics like "Grouped Frequency Distributions"

If you don't understand a term from the python files, there's a high chance it's my traduction. I had this topic in Spanish.

I want for this program to be able to calculate all the results for the exercises/problems of these topics.

## Main Features
As of v0.3.0, these are the operations the program can do:
* Frequency Distributions
  * Simple Frequencies
  * Cumulative Frequencies
* Grouped Frequency Distributions
  * Simple and Cumulative
  * Option to choose a groups' width/size if possible. (Only whole numbers)
  * Option to force a width when the program couldn't calculate one
  * Class Centers
  * Real groups

![example](https://github.com/markalbrand56/Frequency-Distribution_Statistics/blob/master/Examples/Examples.png?raw=true) 

*The program only accepts possitive numbers with up to 1 decimal position*

## New secundary features
v0.4.0 introduces two new features for the program:
* Arithmetic averages for simple frequencies
* Arithmetic averages for simple frequencies

Both are sub-topics of Frequency distributions. The goal is, with the given table of a frquency distribution, to calculate the average of the data with two different methods: standard arithmetic average and arithemtic average using deviation.

_Arithmetic averages for frequency distributions, given the first two columns:_

![example](https://github.com/markalbrand56/Frequency-Distribution_Statistics/blob/master/Examples/Example%203.png?raw=true)

_Arithmetic averages for grouped frequency distributions, given the first two columns:_

![example](https://github.com/markalbrand56/Frequency-Distribution_Statistics/blob/master/Examples/Example%204.png?raw=true)

The modules include some handy features, like letting the user choose the position of the center of the deviation, automatic calculation of the rest of the table of grouped frequencies given the first group and more.
